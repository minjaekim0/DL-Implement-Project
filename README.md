# deeplearning-with-cp
- goal of this project is to understand deeplearning model and its training process in detail.
- make models without famous frameworks(tensorflow, pytorch, ...), just using cupy(very similar with numpy but for cuda)

### DLwithcp
- acts as a DL package
- consists of functions, layers and optimizers

### datasets
- load and save sample datasets

### sample_models
- several models built with DLWithBasicOps
- DFN / CNN / RNN Language Model
